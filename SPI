LOra uses SPI(serial pheriperal interface) which is an syncronous data transfer protocol which is used by the arduino to communicate with
other serial devices.
Typically there are three lines common to all the devices:
MISO (Master In Slave Out) - The Slave line for sending data to the master.
MOSI (Master Out Slave In) - The Master line for sending data to the peripherals.
SCK (Serial Clock) - The clock pulses which synchronize data transmission generated by the master.
Since most of microcontrollers have only 1 set of these pins this makes us to use only 1 serial device, To overcome this we have another
pin called (SS)Slave Select.
When a device's Slave Select pin is low, it communicates with the master. When it's high, it ignores the master.
This allows you to have multiple SPI devices sharing the same MISO, MOSI, and CLK lines.
hhhhh
